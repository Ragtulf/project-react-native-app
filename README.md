# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This is my first app and it is an advice-giving-app using the Advice Slip JSON API


## The problem

The app is done in React Native and using the styled-components library. I looked at some articles on Medium on how to use the shake function on the phone and got to have a peak at Ida LindstrÃ¶m's repo on Github. She used the shake function for her Magic Eightball App.

It is a simple solution where the app toggles between two screens with a question and an answer.
