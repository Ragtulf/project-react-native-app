# Advice App 📱🔮

This is my first native app and it is an advice-giving-app using the Advice Slip JSON API https://api.adviceslip.com/ 

## Tech

- React Native
- JavaScript
- Styled Components
- CSS


## How I did it

The app is done in React Native and using the styled-components library. I looked at some articles on Medium on how to use the shake function on the phone and got to have a peak at Ida Lindström's repo on Github https://github.com/horsefacegirl/project-react-native-app. She used the shake function for her Magic Eightball App.

It is a simple solution where the app toggles between two screens with a question and an answer. 

## View it live

It can be viewed here. 
Note that this is an app that needs to be shook. So please try it out on your phone 🙂🙏🏼📱
